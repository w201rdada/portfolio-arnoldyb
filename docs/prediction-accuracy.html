<h2>Sports opinions abound, reliability metrics are scarce</h2>
<p>My friend Mark told me recently how he had shelled out $500 for a special scouting report to help improve his Fantasy Football draft picks. Mark is among the 60 million people in North America who are playing fantasy sports this year. We spend <a href="http://fsta.org/research/industry-demographics/">$36 billion</a> each year on fantasy sports, with roughly a tenth of that going to published materials like what Mark bought. Much of that material contains predictions by pundits about how various athletes will perform in the coming week and season.</p>
<p>Mark chose the $500 pundit based on word of mouth and a sense that the information must be good if it’s $500. However, Mark is doing worse this season taking the pundit’s advice than last season. It’s easy to laugh and dismiss all pundits as blowhards making guesses like the rest of us. But research says differently. While most forecasters are like the one Mark chose, there is a minority of forecasters who really do <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/01/04/how-to-predict-the-future-better-than-everybody-else/?utm_term=.81864c4dd7c1">outperform dart-throwing chimps</a>.</p>
<p>Could we measure the track record of correct predictions by various pundits so that fantasy sports gamers can focus their reading on the most reliable forecasters, and ultimately, play better?</p>
</div>
<div id="scrape-predictions-crowdsource-their-accuracy" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Scrape predictions, crowdsource their accuracy</h2>
<p>Currently, fantasy gamers do have some limited ways to gauge the accuracy of forecasters. Those pundits who make systematic, numerical-only projections across a full set of athletes can be graded relatively simply – and there are a few (self-interested) <a href="http://fantasyfootballanalytics.net/2016/03/best-fantasy-football-projections-2016-update.html">services out there</a> doing so. Many predictions, however, do not fit this mold but are less systematic, focused on just one athlete, or more qualitative in nature. These predictions are often more interesting as they are offered in the course of conversations between pundits or explained in engaging writeups rather than data tables.</p>
<p>I am proposing a way to measure the reliability of pundits making these less structured forecasts: 1) Use natural language processing to scan sports websites and broadcast transcripts to search for predictions. A prediction must include: a person making the prediction, a timeframe, and a binary outcome. 2) Show the predictions immediately to gamers, along with any reliability measure of the pundit. 3) When each prediction comes due, let gamers weigh in whether the prediction was correct. If a critical mass of gamers agree, rate the prediction as true or false and update the pundit’s reliability score.</p>
<p>For example, John Doe is a pundit who has previously made one correct prediction and four incorrect predictions. He writes that Tom Brady will throw no touchdowns in next Sunday’s game. The prediction is saved to a database and shown to fantasy sports gamers who have Brady on their team, along with a note that John Doe is right 20% of the time. After next week’s game, gamers are shown the prediction again to rate it. Ten people rate the prediction true, no one dissents, and so John Doe’s reliability rating goes to 33%.</p>
</div>
<div id="clean-up-the-information-ecosystem-for-sports-and-beyond" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Clean up the information ecosystem, for sports and beyond</h2>
<p>There are many areas of life where people make predictions. Fantasy sports provides one of the easiest areas to determine pundit reliability given the abundance of predictions, their short time intervals, and the motivation of consumers like Mark to care about reliability.</p>
<p>But the problem remains tricky, even in this space. This model only works with predictions that can be treated as binary, so that leaves out a good deal of nuanced or quantitative forecasting. The model will have to decide how to treat conditionals such as “The U.S. economy <b>could</b> grow by 4% this year.” (I would argue “could” should be treated like a “will.”)</p>
<p>An additional complication: If this tool grew popular, pundits might begin hedging their predictions in ways that make it harder to measure, or they may start making more “no-brainer” predictions that don’t add value. The tool may have to adapt in ways to take into account the perceived difficulty of the prediction.</p>
<p>However, even if flaws emerged, the tool’s usefulness could be easily measured: Take a random sample of fantasy sports gamers and a control group and compare their overall scores. If the tool is shown to work for fantasy sports, it could be adapted for more consequential arenas like business risk intelligence, politics, and even government intelligence. Success would be measured in the declining influence of pundits who are consistently wrong. Mark’s $500 pundit would be put out of business, and maybe too those pundits who predicted Hillary Clinton’s win or an easy and cheap U.S. victory in Iraq would fall out of our news feeds.</p>
