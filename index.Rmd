I am interested in the intersection between data science and the media industry. Written word communication represents a significant chunk of the world's amassed data. In that data could be the answers to some of the enigmas of our age, including how to persuade climate deniers, how to eradicate fake news, and how to determine who's a reliable pundit.

### Abstract: Winning Public Opinion by Measuring Minds Changed
Organizations tasked with changing public opinion do not have fast or cheap ways to figure out which messages work best. Nor can they easily measure success: A blog post might go viral, but that doesn't mean it changed anyone's mind. I propose a new mechanism for discovering the most persuasive messaging by searching and analyzing online discussions on specific topics. An algorithm will look at individual commenters over the span of years and will conduct sentiment analysis on their posts to find any change of mind. The algorithm will then look for new words or phrases used at the moment of change and trace them back to a source article or comment, in this way identifying persuasive texts. Organizations can use the real-world, real-time trends found in these persuasive texts to replace expensive focus group testing and become better at communicating outside their bubbles.

### Abstract: Tracking Pundit Reliability in Fantasy Sports
Research has found that the majority of experts making forecasts had a track record no better than random chance -- but a minority of pundits were reliably accurate. Identifying those reliable pundits in a relevant field would give an information edge to anyone making bets on future events. I propose a way to build a tool to measure forecaster reliability for the fantasy sports industry. The tool would use natural language processing to extract measurable predictions from the vast output of fantasy sports publishing. As predictions come due, each would be judged for accuracy through crowdsourcing and the pundit's reliability rating would be subsequently moved upward or downward. Lessons learned in the easier arena of fantasy sports could then be applied to more difficult but more consequential arenas such as business risk intelligence, politics, and government intelligence.
