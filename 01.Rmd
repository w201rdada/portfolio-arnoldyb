## A beginning.

Imagine you make a video to convince Americans that climate change is real and the video goes viral. Let's say 10 million people view it. Were you successful? It's impossible to answer that question without knowing how many of the viewers were climate skeptics before watching and accepted climate change after watching. This problem is writ large across organizations tasked with changing public opinion. Unlike online retailers with digital shopping carts, organizations that are selling ideas don't have a "buy" button to monitor. Consequently, these organizations -- including foundations, think tanks, political parties, and special interest groups -- are spending billions of dollars on content that they only vaguely know to be effective.

## A middle.

Current solutions to the problem include focus groups and polling. Focus groups can measure the effectiveness of specific messaging phrases on a very small group in a highly artificial setting. Polling captures self-reported shifts in broad public opinion, but can't easily pinpoint that to any given content.

Data science offers new possibilities for measuring the persuasiveness of content. Populations can be split into opinion groups using [sentiment analysis](/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) of their social media posts on the topic. Certain group can be pushed persuasive content and monitored for changes in sentiment in their reaction and in any subsequent social media posts on the topic. In this way, opinion marketers can start to build conversion rate metrics on content, and piece together more sophisticated [remarketing campaigns](/http://rejoiner.com/resources/remarketing-vs-retargeting-whats-the-difference/).

Cambridge Analytica, the firm hired by the Brexit and Trump campaigns, showed the power of using big data to shift opinion. Evidence suggests they used the data captured from Facebook likes (among other data) to build personality profiles of the entire U.S. population, then delivered individuals specific online content to influence their opinions of Trump and Clinton. This new realm of personality targeting is showing impressive returns, with new research showing a boost of up to [63 percent more clicks](/https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mg9vvn/how-our-likes-helped-trump-win) on Facebook ad campaigns.

Trump and Cambridge Analytica brought new sophistication to targeting in political campaigns, but it's not clear they used anything innovative in determining which messages worked best. Like any presidential campaign, Team Trump had significant data from the Republican Party on voters from previous elections, and they could gauge opinion shifts among targeted voters through phone and door-to-door canvassing by volunteers. That's not realistic or efficient for most organizations; instead, conversion rate metrics built on sentiment analysis could give smaller organizations the tool they need to hone messages for targeted personality groups.

## An end.

This initial solution to the problem of measuring what changes minds faces some serious limitations. Initial measurements may reveal that it is very rare for anyone's mind to change based on one piece of content, or that such shifts don't last very long without continuous messaging. And "change of mind" is rarely a binary event (a sudden flip from disagree to agree), but a slow shift along a continuum of opinion that may be harder to measure. But we won't know these shortfalls until taking this first step toward measuring persuasion. The solution would likely face ethical concerns around the tracking of individuals' opinions. But on the flip side, better persuasive content could help people come to more informed and less predictable opinions in this hyper-partisan age.
