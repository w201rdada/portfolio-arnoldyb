## Moving beyond focus groups and traffic data

Imagine you are tasked with writing an article to convince Americans that climate change is real. What resources would you consult before writing, and after you hit publish how would you measure success? These questions are familiar and frustrating to anyone working in advocacy communications. 

Organizations with significant budgets can pay for framing research. Consultants compile a set of test messages and discuss them with focus groups. If the organization has even more money, they might conduct some polling. Aside from the expense, such tests take months.

Determining the success of any persuasive content is tougher yet. Organizations look to pageviews, likes, and shares of their content for indicators of what connected. But engagement metrics don't equal agreement and don't reveal if the audience was already converted.

Could we improve on this expensive guesswork for clients like foundations, think tanks, and political campaigns by actually observing people changing their minds in online discourse?

## Analyzing the text of discussion forums to find mental shifts

I am proposing a tool that builds a database of online commenters who have opined on the client's issue of interest. The database -- containing commenters, their comments, a date, and contextual relationships -- would be populated by searching discussion forums such as Reddit and Disqus through their APIs and feeds. Natural language processing techniques would be critical to identifying relevant discussions.

Next, sentiment analysis would be conducted across the database, searching for cases where individual commenters appear to have shifted their attitude on the issue of interest. A shift could also be identified by a change in upvotes or likes on the topic. For those whose opinions shifted, the tool would look for the emergence of new phrases and keywords near the time of the attitude shift and attempt to match those back to an article or a comment in a thread. In this way, the tool would identify the text that persuaded. 

The client would receive the texts that persuaded, as well as analysis on those texts to find most common keywords and phrases, tones, and author characteristics. This analysis would be superior to framing research in that it draws ideas from far more people, it continually updates in real-time, it is based on observed change rather than self-reporting in an artificial focus-group, and it would eventually be cheaper to produce. 

The tool could also highlight mind-changing content published by the client or quoting their staff, thereby giving organizations a way to measure minds changed by their communication efforts. This, not engagement, is the true metric of interest.

## Avoiding 'manipulation' by staying within ethical boundaries

The clients for this project -- advocacy organizations -- have nothing more precious than their reputation, so the project is designed to adhere to strong ethical standards. Specifically:

1. The solution avoids experimenting with unsuspecting users in favor of observing their expressions on public fora. The data gathering does not rely on the client to push (or take away) messages in front of users as part of a secret experiment, as Facebook did with its controversial [emotional contagion experiment](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369118X.2015.1093525?journalCode=rics20). 

2. The algorithm would be listening to the wisdom of the crowds, uncovering the most persuasive arguments from both published writers and millions of commentors alike. This bottom-up approach shows respect for the notion of a [democratic public square](http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i218/s15/calhoun_BPSIntroduction.pdf). 

3. The data gathering would be limited to public discussion forums where anonymity is greater rather than social networks where user identities and psychographics are more fully known. This should limit the ability of clients to veer into quick manipulation of [Type 1 thinking](https://ericrshelton.com/2015/12/21/type-1-and-type-2-thinking/) and keep them focused on deliberative [Type 2 thinking](https://ericrshelton.com/2015/12/21/type-1-and-type-2-thinking/).  

The controversy over ["fake news"](https://www.wired.com/2017/02/veles-macedonia-fake-news/) and [Russian social media advertising](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/facebook-russia-adverts-americans-exposed-trump-us-election-2016-millions-a8028526.html) during the 2016 U.S. election highlights a growing public concern over unscrupulous efforts to [manipulate opinion online](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mg9vvn/how-our-likes-helped-trump-win). This project points to a way to improve persuasion that doesn't rely on churning out deceptive copy, invading people's privacy, or undermining democratic discourse.
